# Cosmos Role

Ansible role to manage Cosmos-SDK based blockchain nodes.

## Requirements

The Cosmos-SDK based chains are distributed for may operating systems.
Check the project's GitHub repository to see if it releases binary for the
operating system of your choice. But this role only targeting the Linux/Unix 
based OS.

### Golang

This role doesn't attempt to install the golang, but assumes it is available
at the default location `/usr/local/go/bin`. The default location can be overridden
with the `golang_bin_dir` variable when executing the role.

Tip: Golang can be installed with Ansible Galaxy [gantsign.golang](https://galaxy.ansible.com/gantsign/golang) role or similar.

### Role Variables

The role loads the variables in the following order:

:arrow_down: Role defaults `defaults/main.yml`  
:arrow_down: Role chain variables `vars/<chain>.yml` (optional)  
:arrow_down: Playbook `vars`  
:arrow_down: Role `vars`  
:arrow_down: Role parameters  

As noted, the Cosmos-SDK based chain might have optional variables file
(e.g. `vars/osmosis.yml`) to override certain config variables.

The general rule here, if it makes sense to have the parameter configurable,
then submit a pull request to add the flag to `defaults/main.yml` or 
`vars/<chain>.yml` for specific chain overrides, and modify `tasks/config.yml` or
`tasks/config_<chain>.yml` to apply the introduced variable.

### SystemD ExecStart

The execution command is the following:

```shell
{{ bin_dir }}/{{ chain_bin }} start --home {{ data_dir }} {{ extra_run_args }}
```

Some Cosmos-SDK based chains accept additional parameters as command-line flags.
These flags can be specified via `extra_run_args` variable. F.e. `terrad` suggests
`--x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants` flag to start syncing the node since the last upgrade 
until it is at the current height (we have already set this variable in `vars/terra.yml`).

## Example Playbook

```yaml
---
- hosts: "all"
  gather_facts: true
  become: true

  roles:
    - role: gantsign.golang
      golang_version: "1.18.1"
      golang_install_dir: /usr/local/go

    - role: trustwallet.blockchain.cosmos
      chain_name: osmosis
      data_dir: /mnt/data/.osmosisd # example of custom data_dir, default is /home/cosmos/.osmosisd
      quicksync_mode: default # options are pruned, default, archive and none (sync from scratch)

```

## Popular Questions

### What ports does Cosmos-SDK based chain node use?

By default chain's binary uses the following ports:

* `26656` - p2p networking port to connect to the tendermint network
  On a validator this port needs to be exposed to sentry nodes
  On a sentry node this port needs to be exposed to the open internet

* `26657` - Tendermint RPC port
  This should be shielded from the open internet

* `26658` - Out of process ABCI app
  This should be shielded from the open internet

* `26660` - Prometheus stats server
  Stats about the gaiad process
  Needs to be enabled in the config file .
  This should be shielded from the open internet

* `1317` - Light Client Daemon
  For automated management of anything you can do with the CLI
  This should be shielded from the open internet, unless public sentry node is planned.

## Development

To aid in the development and testing of the Ansible role, we are 
using [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) roles testing framework.

The role to test the Cosmos-SDK based chains, expects the `COSMOS_CHAIN_NAME` parameter
to be set as environment variable.

```shell
COSMOS_CHAIN_NAME=osmosis molecule -v test -s cosmos
```
